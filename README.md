## Description

Enhanced Falling Trees allows trees to fall realistically when cut down, however, the mod only slightly adds realism and has nothing to do with physics as such, it only simulates a fall for the sake of performance, simulating a falling tree.

Additionally, enjoy enhanced visual and auditory features with particle effects as the tree disappears and a wide range of impact and falling sounds. (inspired by The Forset)

## Features
- **Realistic Tree Falling:** (also bamboo and cactus are supported) Trees no longer simply disappear; they fall over realistically when cut.
- **Particle Effects:** (for trees) Witness a stunning display of particles as trees disappear after falling.
- **Dynamic Sounds:** A wide variety of sounds accompany the falling and impact of trees, enhancing the immersive experience.

## Compatibility

## Known issues
- Sometimes when a tree falls, some part of it may fall into the ground, or physics doesn't work as expected. Why?

  -     This is normal behavior and will probably be fixed soon. 
  **Reminder:** _This is just an imitation of physics using simple functions and formulas, so sometimes its behavior may not be entirely correct._
