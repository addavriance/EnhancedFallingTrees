## Description

Enhanced Falling Trees allows trees to fall realistically when cut down, however, the mod only slightly adds realism and has nothing to do with physics as such, it only simulates a fall for the sake of performance, simulating a falling tree.

Additionally, enjoy enhanced visual and auditory features with particle effects as the tree disappears and a wide range of impact and falling sounds.
